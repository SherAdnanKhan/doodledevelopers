      <h2 class="text-2xl">Winners</h2>
      <p>
        5.1 Competition winners will be announced on the website and the
        Promoter will attempt to contact winners of Competitions using the
        telephone numbers and/or email address provided at the time of Entry (or
        as subsequently updated) and held securely in our database. It is the
        Entrant’s responsibility to ensure that these details are accurate, up
        to date and complete. If for any reason these details are taken down,
        inputted and/or submitted and/or recorded in any way by you incorrectly,
        the Promoter will not be held responsible for any consequences of this
        of whatever nature and howsoever arising. Entrants must carefully check
        their contact details have been recorded correctly.
      </p>
      <p>
        5.2 If the promoter is unable to contact the winner in order to claim
        their prize after a reasonable period (1 calendar month) or is unable to
        verify the identity to the satisfaction of the promoter’s identity
        verification requirements, then the winner shall forfeit their ability
        to claim the prize fund, and the prize fund shall henceforth become the
        property of the promoter.
      </p>
      <p>
        5.3 The Promoter also reserves the right at its sole discretion to
        extend the closing date of any Competition. Each Competition can have
        the closing time extended by the Promoter up to 4 times. If the
        Competition does not reach its desired prize fund target after the 4th
        extension of time, then the Prize fund will go to the individual(s) with
        the highest score.
      </p>
      <p>
        5.4 If the prize fund surpasses the ‘up to’ cash prize, then runners up
        cash prizes will be distributed.
      </p>
      <p>
        5.5 If the prize fund surpasses the ‘up to’ cash prize and runners up
        cash prizes, all cash value prizes will be increased. Limited only to
        the size of the prize fund.
      </p>
      <p>
        5.6 In the event of winners sharing the same score, prize giving will be
        determined by which individuals achieved the shared high score the
        quickest.
      </p>
      <p>
        5.7 The winner will be determined by the player who has achieved the
        highest score, in the quickest time, and is at the top of the leader
        board.
      </p>
      <p>
        5.8 A runner up will be determined by the next highest score following
        the winner. A runner up will never receive a prize greater than the
        overall winner(s). For example, if there are 5 players sharing the high
        score and time with one player with the second highest score, the prize
        fund will be adjusted to ensure the highest score players receive a
        bigger prize than the player with the second highest score.
      </p>
      <p>
        5.9 Winners will receive their cash prize in the same personal bank
        account which was used purchased the entry fee(s). Once the promotor is
        satisfied with the winner(s) KYC documents, transactions may take up to
        14 working days.

        13.1 If the Promoter fails and/or delays to enforce a provision of the
        terms and conditions, this failure and/or delay is not a waiver of the
        Promoter’s right to do so later.
      </p>
      <p>
        13.2 If any provision (or part of a provision) of these terms and
        conditions is decided by a court of competent jurisdiction to be void
        and/or unenforceable, that decision will only affect the particular
        provision (or part of the provision) and will not make the other
        provisions void or unenforceable.
      </p>
      <p>
        13.3 You may not assign or otherwise transfer (in whole or in part) your
        rights and/or obligations under these terms and conditions. Any breach
        of this rule (13.3) may result in the use of your account and/or the
        provision of the Competition and/or access to the Website being
        suspended or terminated immediately by the Promoter. The Promoter may
        assign or otherwise their rights and/or obligations under these terms
        and conditions in whole or in part to any third party at its sole and
        absolute discretion and without your consent. The Promoter may also
        assign these terms and conditions in their entirety, without your
        consent, to its successor in interest in connection with a merger,
        reorganisation, or sale of all or substantially all assets or equity.
        These terms and conditions shall bind and inure to the Promoter’s
        benefit, its successors, and permitted assigns.
      </p>
      <p>
        13.4 These terms and conditions constitute the entire agreement between
        you and the Promoter regarding the subject matter of these terms
        conditions and supersede and replace any other prior and/or
        contemporaneous agreements, and/or terms and conditions applicable to
        the subject matter of these terms and conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        13.5 A person who is not a party to these terms and conditions has no
        rights to enforce any provision of these terms and conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        13.6 The Promoter will not be liable for any delay or failure to perform
        any obligation under these terms and conditions where the delay or
        failure results from any cause beyond its reasonable control, including
        acts of God, labour disputes or other industrial disturbances,
        electrical or power outages, utilities or other
        telecommunication/network failures, earthquake, storms, or other
        elements of nature, blockages, embargoes, riots, acts or orders of
        government, acts of terrorism, or war.
