    <h2 class="text-2xl">The Kind of Information We Hold About You</h2>
    <p>
      Personal data, or personal information, means any information about an
      individual from which that person can be identified. It does not include
      data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data).
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl">How Is Your Personal Information Collected?</h2>
    <p>
      We collect personal information about our customers when you contact us,
      create an account or provide use with your information for a specific
      purpose.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl">How We Will Use Information About You?</h2>
    <p>
      We will only use your personal information when the law allows us to. Most
      commonly, we will use your personal information in the following
      circumstances:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Where we need to comply with a legal obligation.</li>
      <li>
        Where you have entered into a contract with us to provide you with a
        service, an example being your account details.
      </li>
      <li>
        Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third
        party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those
        interests.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      We may also use your personal information in the following situations,
      which are likely to be rare:

    <ol>

        Where you have given you consent to contact you for a specific purpose.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="text-2xl">Change of purpose</h2>
    <p>
      We will only use your personal information for the purposes for which we
      collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for
      another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If
      we need to use your personal information for an unrelated purpose, we will
      notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note that we may process your personal information without your
      knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is
      required or permitted by law.

      where we have another legitimate interest in doing so.

      share only the data you have given your consent to share.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl">Data Security</h2>
    <p>

    <p>

      breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a suspected
      breach where we are legally required to do so.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl">Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      We will only retain your personal information for as long as necessary to
      fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of
      satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. To determine
      the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the
      amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk
      of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the
      purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can
      achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal
      requirements.
    </p>

      In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal information so that
      it can no longer be associated with you, in which case we may use such
      information without further notice to you.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl">
      Rights of Access, Correction, Erasure, and Restriction
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is important that the personal information we hold about you is
      accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your personal information
      changes during your relationship with us.
    </p>
    <p>Under certain circumstances, by law you have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Request access</strong> to your personal information (commonly
        known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a
        copy of the personal information we hold about you and to check that we
        are lawfully processing it.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Request correction</strong> of the personal information that we
        hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate
        information we hold about you corrected.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Request erasure</strong>§ of your personal information. This
        enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where
        there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have
        the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where
        you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Object to processing</strong> of your personal information where
        we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and
        there is something about your particular situation which makes you want
        to object to processing on this ground. You also have the right to
        object where we are processing your personal information for direct
        marketing purposes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Request the restriction of processing</strong> of your personal
        information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of
        personal information about you, for example if you want us to establish
        its accuracy or the reason for processing it.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Request the transfer</strong> of your personal information to
        another party.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If you want to review, verify, correct or request erasure of your personal
      information, object to the processing of your personal data, or request
      that we transfer a copy of your personal information to another party,
      please contact <a href="mailto:data@red6six.com">data@red6six.com</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to
      exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee
      if your request for access is clearly unfounded or excessive.
      Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with the request in such
      circumstances.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl">What we may need from you</h2>
    <p>
      We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm
      your identity and ensure your right to access the information (or to
      exercise any of your other rights). This is another appropriate security
      measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person
      who has no right to receive it.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will respond to your request without undue delay but certainly within 4
      weeks of verifying your identity.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl">Right to Withdraw Consent</h2>
    <p>
      In the limited circumstances where you may have provided your consent to
      the collection, processing and transfer of your personal information for a
      specific purpose, you have the right to withdraw your consent for that
      specific processing at any time. To withdraw your consent, please contact
      our DPM. Once we have received notification that you have withdrawn your
      consent, we will no longer process your information for the purpose or
      purposes you originally agreed to, unless we have another legitimate basis
      for doing so in law.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl">Changes to this Privacy Notice</h2>
    <p>
      We reserve the right to update this privacy notice at any time, and we
      will provide you with a new privacy notice when we make any substantial
      updates.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may also notify you in other ways from time to time about the
      processing of your personal information.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl">Complaints</h2>
    <p>
      We’d like the chance to resolve any complaints you may have however you
      also have the right to complain to the Jersey Office of the Information
